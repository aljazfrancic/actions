# Test All Actions

This workflow runs automated tests for all openDAQ GitHub Actions in this repository.

## üìå Purpose

- Ensures that all actions work correctly.
- Runs shared workflows for each action.
- Can be used in pull requests to verify changes before merging.

---

## üöÄ Usage

This workflow is triggered automatically on:

- `push` to `main`

No manual configuration is needed ‚Äî it automatically runs tests for all actions listed in the matrix.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Matrix

Currently tested actions (via their **testing workflows**):

> TODO: add a shared testing workflow for each action here

- [ ] test-framework-download-artifact
- [ ] test-framework-download-release
- [ ] test-framework-install-package

You can add new actions to the matrix in `test-all-actions.yml` when new actions are added to the repository.
